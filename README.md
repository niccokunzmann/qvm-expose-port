# qvm-expose-port

Expose a qubes vm port to the public interfaces of the sys-net vm.

To expose port 8000 of the `work` VM, run

    user@dom0$ qvm-expose-port -a work 8000

E.g. you can run an http server in the `work` VM:

    user@work$ python3 -m http.server

Now, you can access the http server from the outside.

Installation
------------

You can install the script by downloading it.

    user@work$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/niccokunzmann/qvm-expose-port/master/qvm-expose-port

Copy it to dom0 and make it executable.

    user@dom0$ qvm-run --pass-io work 'cat qvm-expose-port' > qvm-expose-port
    user@dom0$ chmod +x qvm-expose-port
    user@dom0$ sudo mv qvm-expose-port /usr/local/bin/
